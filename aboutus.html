			<h1>About Us</h1>

			<p>
				BubbleNetwork is an American for-profit corporation and an
				online social media and social networking service based in
				Menlo Park, California. The Facebook website was launched on
				February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow
				Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin,
				Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The founders had initially limited the website's membership
				to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to
				higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy
				League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually
				added support for students at various other universities,
				and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006,
				anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old has been
				allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though
				variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending
				on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the
				face book directories often given to United States
				university students.
			</p>

			<p>

				Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops,
				laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet
				and mobile networks. After registering to use the site,
				users can create a user profile indicating their name,
				occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other
				users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates
				and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use
				various software applications ("apps"), and receive
				notifications when others update their profiles or make
				posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user
				groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other
				topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as
				"People From Work" or "Close Friends". In groups, editors
				can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about
				or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of
				data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come
				under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most
				of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen,
				marketing access for its customers to its users and offering
				highly selective advertising opportunities.
